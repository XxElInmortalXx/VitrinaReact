## Used Technologies Stack

**Client:** React, TailwindCSS, vite (Vanilla), APIs

## Optimizations

I focus on MVP (minimum viable product). The code is in its initial versions, in future updates I will make improvements to the code such as code optimizations and componentization and separation of functionalities as a separate folder.
